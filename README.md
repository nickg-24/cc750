Code for dockerhub covert channel.

## Notes:
- `old_transmission_log.json` contains the accounts that have been used so far. There are quite a few test containers on these accounts.
- last test container naming scheme was `nov6test1-{img}`
- ask prof about the scope of our project
    - Our "contribution" is the methodology (i.e., the workflow of modifying images and distrubuting them using dockerhub). We use the crontabs/root file but any file encoding scheme could be used. Maybe we can talk about the wide variety of file steganography that already exist (image, code, config file) and how they can be applied using our methodology.

## To Do's
- [ ] Think about randomizing the file that encodes the data
- [ ] automating the reciever at least
- [ ] figuring out polling timing
- [ ] check to make sure that the react app still works for generated images
