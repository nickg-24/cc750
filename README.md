# cc750
Code for dockerhub covert channel.

## Notes:
- `old_transmission_log.json` contains the accounts that have been used so far. There are quite a few test containers on these accounts.
- last test container naming scheme was `nov6test1-{img}`

## To Do's
- [ ] Think about randomizing the file that encodes the data
- [ ] automating the reciever at least
- [ ] figuring out polling timing
